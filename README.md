# nock-back-ci

A simple acceptance testing helper optimised for complex CI problems

## Motivation

As responsible developers we want to test our NodeJS service with acceptance tests to simulate real traffic.

In a continuous deployment environment, the CI pipeline should be able to run those acceptance tests,
however, the deployment of our service shouldnâ€™t depend on an external service being up and running.

To this, we also need to add the fact that often, our service relies on a secrets provider service that
is not available from the CI pipeline.
